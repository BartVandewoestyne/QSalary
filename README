As a couple, you might have a bank account that you and your partner use to make
your daily payments for food and stuff.  Some couples might decide that the
amount of money they each transfer to this bank account depends on the ratio of
their incomes.  QSalary is a small application that two persons from a household
can use to decide how much of each's salary should be transferred to a common
'household' bank account, taking into account the ratio of their incomes.

QSalary is my first experiment with Qt programming.  I just needed *something*
to implement, so I created this little application.
